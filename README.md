# NicksAPPS

## Java
All apps are contained inside a NetBeans Project.

### ArraysPlus
Additional Java methods that work on arrays. Includes multiple comparator sorting, case-agnostic String array operations, and primitive-to-reference array converters.

### MainPlus
Methods I found myself copy-pasting too many times. Includes methods to neatly close and end if an Exception is caught and some debugging tools.

### MathPlus
Additional Java methods that perform mathematical operations such as reciprocal trigonometric functions and linear and geometric sequencing.

### NumberList
Extends ArrayList\<Number\> to enable mathematical operations on vectors of numbers. Includes summation, product, mean, etc.

### RobotPlus
Extends Robot to enable commonly desired functionality when trying to write bots. Includes screen readers, special delays, and special click and type commands. Uses Keyboard.java.

### ScannerPlus
Additional Java methods that work with Scanners to parse text by skipping lines until the desired location in the text is reached.

### StringList
Extends ArrayList\<String\> to enable special manipulation on Lists of Strings. Includes concatenation and case-agnostic comparisons.

### StringPlus
Additional Java methods that perform String operations such as HTML cleaning and format checking.

## MATLAB
Functions and scripts for various MATLAB applications.

### BestLinearSlope
The least-squares slope of a regression line whose y-intercept is zero.

### BinaryVectorToHex
Converts binary vector to hexadecimal string.

### CoordList2Mat
Transforms a vector with corresponding coordinate lists into a mesh for surface plotting.

### Correlation
Vector correlation.

### Logbase
Arbitrary-base logarithm.

### Logbasespace
Logarithmically spaced vector.

### MBodeMag
Adds the single-sided amplitude spectrum to a measurement structure.

### NthMax
Returns the nth-greatest element in a vector and its index.

### NthMin
Returns the nth-least element in a vector and its index.

### Number_Pattern
Returns the regular expression pattern for numbers.

### OFT
Optimal Fourier transform. Returns the FFT of a time-domain signal zero-padded such that the maximum amplitude response of the signal is optimized.

### OptiTrack_csv2struct
Extracts data from OptiTrack output.

### PeakBandStop
Butterworth bandstop filter on highest-amplitude frequency.

### Point2
Returns the slope and y-intercept of a line given two points.

### PropertySet
Sets function property structure. Useful in functions with many optional arguments.

### SFT
Specific Fourier transform. Returns the FFT of a time-domain signal zero-padded such that a target frequency is directly in the middle of a bin.

### SSAmpSpec
Single-sided amplitude spectrum.

### Stretch
Stretches a vector to a new length.

### ToSignal and ToSignalD
Calculates complex signal.

### TSAmpSpec
Two-sided amplitude spectrum.

### Unwrap_RevSet
Unwrap phase angle.

### VecAngle2
Calculate angle between two vectors in R2.
