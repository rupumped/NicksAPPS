## MATLAB
Functions and scripts for various MATLAB applications.

### BestLinearSlope
The least-squares slope of a regression line whose y-intercept is zero.

### BinaryVectorToHex
Converts binary vector to hexadecimal string.

### CoordList2Mat
Transforms a vector with corresponding coordinate lists into a mesh for surface plotting.

### Correlation
Vector correlation.

### Logbase
Arbitrary-base logarithm.

### Logbasespace
Logarithmically spaced vector.

### MBodeMag
Adds the single-sided amplitude spectrum to a measurement structure.

### NthMax
Returns the nth-greatest element in a vector and its index.
